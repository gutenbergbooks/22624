<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>ADDRESS TO OUR FRIENDS.</h3>

  <p>We this day publish our fifty-second Number. Every Saturday, for
  twelve months, have we presented to our subscribers our weekly budget of
  "<span class="sc">Notes</span>," "<span class="sc">Queries</span>," and
  "<span class="sc">Replies</span>;" and in so doing, we trust, we have
  accomplished some important ends. We have both amused and instructed the
  general reader; we have stored up much curious knowledge for the use of
  future writers; we have procured for scholars now engaged in works of
  learning and research, many valuable pieces of information which had
  evaded their own immediate pursuit; and, lastly, in doing all this, we
  have powerfully helped forward the great cause of literary truth.</p>

  <p>In our Prospectus and opening address we made no great promise of what
  our paper should be. That, we knew, must depend upon how far the medium
  of intercommunication we had prepared should be approved and adopted by
  those for whose special use it had been projected. We laid down a
  literary railway: it remained to be seen whether the world of letters
  would travel by it. They have done so: we have been especially patronised
  by first-class passengers, and in such numbers that we were obliged last
  week to run an extra train.</p>

  <p>It is obvious that the use of a paper like "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>" bears a direct proportion to the extent of its
  circulation. What it aims at doing is, to reach the learning which lies
  scattered not only throughout every part of our own country, but all over
  the literary world, and to bring it all to bear upon the pursuits of the
  scholar; to enable, in short, men of letters all over the world to give a
  helping hand to one another. To a certain extent, we have accomplished
  this end. Our last number contains communications not only from all parts
  of the metropolis, and from almost every county in England, but also from
  Scotland, Ireland, Holland, and even from Demerara. This looks well. It
  seems as if we were in a fair way to accomplish our design. But much yet
  remains to be done. We have recently been told of whole districts in
  England so benighted as never to have heard of "<span class="sc">Notes
  and Queries</span>;" and after an interesting question has been discussed
  for weeks in our columns, we are informed of some one who could have
  answered it immediately if he had seen it. So long as this is the case
  the advantage we may confer upon literature and literary men is
  necessarily imperfect. We do what we can to make known our existence
  through the customary modes of announcement, and we gratefully
  acknowledge the kind assistance and encouragement we derive from our
  brethren of the public press; but we would respectfully solicit <!-- Page
  354 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page354"></a>{354}</span>the
  assistance of our friends this particular point. Our purpose is aided,
  and our usefulness increased by every introduction which can be given to
  our paper, either to a Book Club, to a Lending Library, or to any other
  channel of circulation amongst persons of inquiry and intelligence. By
  such introductions scholars help themselves as well as us, for there is
  no inquirer throughout the kingdom who is not occasionally able to throw
  light upon some of the multifarious objects which are discussed in our
  pages.</p>

  <p>At the end of our first twelvemonth we thank our subscribers for the
  patronage we have received. We trust we shall go on week by week
  improving in our work of usefulness, so that at the end of the next
  twelvemonth we may meet them with the same pleasure as on the present
  occasion. We will continue to do whatever is in our power, and we rely
  upon our friends to help us.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S USE OF THE WORDS "CAPTIOUS" AND "INTENIBLE."</h3>

  <p>In the following passage of <i>All's Well that Ends Well</i>, Act i.
  Sc. 3., where Helena is confessing to Bertram's mother, the Countess, her
  love for him, these two words occur in an unusual sense, if not in a
  sense peculiar to the great poet:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I love your son:&mdash;</p>
      <p>My friends were poor, but honest, so's my love:</p>
      <p>Be not offended, for it hurts not him,</p>
      <p>That he is lov'd of me: I follow him not</p>
      <p>By any token of presumptuous suit;</p>
      <p>Nor would I have him till I do deserve him:</p>
      <p>Yet never know how that desert may be.</p>
      <p>I know I love in vain; strive against hope;</p>
      <p>Yet, in this <i>captious and intenible</i> sieve</p>
      <p>I still pour in the waters of my love,</p>
      <p>And lack not to lose still."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Johnson was perplexed about the word <i>captious</i>; "which (says he)
  I never found in this sense, yet I cannot tell what to substitute, unless
  <i>carious</i> for rotten!" Farmer supposed <i>captious</i> to be a
  contraction of <i>capacious</i>! Steevens believed that <i>captious</i>
  meant <i>recipient</i>, capable of receiving; which interpretation Malone
  adopts. Mr. Collier, in his recent edition of Shakspeare, after stating
  Johnson's and Farmer's suggestions, says, "where is the difficulty? It is
  true that this sense of <i>captious</i> may not have an exact parallel;
  but the intention of Shakspeare is very evident: <i>captious</i> means,
  as Malone says, capable of <i>taking</i> or <i>receiving</i>; and
  <i>intenible</i> (printed <i>intemible</i> in the first folio, and
  rightly in the second) incapable of <i>retaining</i>. Two more
  appropriate epithets could hardly be found, and a simile more happily
  expressive."</p>

  <p>We no doubt all know, by intuition as it were, what Shakspeare meant;
  but "the great master of English," as <span class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span>
  very justly calls him, would never have used <i>captious</i>, as applied
  figuratively to a <i>sieve</i>, for <i>capable of taking or
  receiving</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Intenible</i>, notwithstanding the hypercriticism of Mr. Nares
  (that "it is incorrectly used by Shakspeare for <i>unable to hold</i>;"
  and that "it should properly mean <i>not to be held</i>, as we now use
  <i>untenable</i>") was undoubtedly used in the former sense, and it was
  most probably so accepted in the poet's time; for in the <i>Glossagraphia
  Anglicana Nova</i>, 1719, we have "Untenable, that <i>will not or cannot
  hold</i> or be holden long."</p>

  <p>With regard to <i>captious</i>, it is not so much a matter of surprise
  that none of all these learned commentators should fail in their
  <i>guesses</i> at the meaning, as that none of them should have remarked
  that the sense of the Latin <i>captiosus</i>, and of its congeners in
  Italian and old French, is <i>deceitful</i>, <i>fallacious</i>; and Bacon
  uses the word for <i>insidious, ensnaring</i>. There can be no doubt that
  this is the sense in which Shakspeare used it. Helen speaks of her
  hopeless love for Bertram, and says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I know I love in vain, strive against hope; yet in this
  <i>fallacious</i> and <i>unholding</i> sieve I still pour in the waters
  of my love, and fail not to lose still."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>When we speak of a <i>captious</i> person, do we mean one <i>capable
  of taking or receiving</i>? Then how much more absurd would it be to take
  it in that impossible sense, when figuratively applied in the passage
  before us! Bertram shows himself <i>incapable of receiving</i> Helena's
  love: he is truly <i>captious</i> in that respect.</p>

  <p>In French the word <i>captieux</i>, according to the Academy, is only
  applied to language, though we may say <i>un homme captieux</i> to
  signify a man who has the art of <i>deceiving</i> or leading into error
  by captious language.</p>

  <p>It is not impossible that the poet may have had in his mind the
  fruitless labour imposed upon the Danaïdes as a punishment, for it has
  been thus moralised:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"These virgins, who in the flower of their age pour water into pierced
  vessels which they can never fill, what is it but to be always bestowing
  over love and benefits upon the ungrateful."</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>ORATORIES OF THE NONJURORS.</h3>

  <p>As the nooks and corners of London in olden times are now engaging the
  quiet musings of most of the topographical brotherhood, perhaps you can
  spare a nook or a corner of your valuable periodical for a few notes on
  the Oratories of those good men and true&mdash;the Nonjurors. "These were
  honourable men in their generation," and were made of most unbending
  materials.</p>

<p><!-- Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page355"></a>{355}</span></p>

  <p>On the Feast of St. Matthias, Feb. 24, 1693, the consecrations of Dr.
  George Hickes and Thomas Wagstaffe were solemnly performed according to
  the rites of the Church of England, by Dr. William Lloyd, bishop of
  Norwich; Dr. Francis Turner, bishop of Ely; and Dr. Thomas White, bishop
  of Peterborough, at the Bishop of Peterborough's lodgings, at the Rev.
  William Giffard's house at Southgate in Middlesex: Dr. Ken, bishop of
  Bath and Wells, giving his consent.</p>

  <p>Henry Hall was consecrated bishop in the oratory of the Rev. Father in
  Christ, John B&mdash;&mdash; [Blackburne?], in Gray's Inn, on the
  festival of St. Barnabas, June 11, 1725.</p>

  <p>Hilkiah Bedford was consecrated in the oratory of the Rev.
  R&mdash;&mdash; R&mdash;&mdash; [Richard Rawlinson], in Gray's Inn, on
  the festival of St. Paul, Jan. 25, 1720. Ralph Taylor was also
  consecrated at the same time and place.</p>

  <p>Henry Gandy was consecrated at his oratory in the parish of St.
  Andrew's, Holborn, on the festival of St. Paul, Jan. 25, 1716.</p>

  <p>Grascome was interrupted by a messenger whilst he was ministering to
  his little congregation in Scroope's Court, near St. Andrew's Church.</p>

  <p>Jeremy Collier officiated at Broad Street, London, assisted by the
  Rev. Samuel Carte, the father of the historian.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hawkes officiated for some time at his own house opposite to St.
  James' Palace.</p>

  <p>On Easter-day, April 13, 1718, at the oratory of his brother, Mr.
  William Lee, dyer, in Spitalfields, Dr. Francis Lee read a touching and
  beautiful declaration of his faith, betwixt the reading of the sentences
  at the offertory and the prayer for the state of Christ's church. It was
  addressed to the Rev. James Daillon, Count de Lude, then officiating.</p>

  <p>Charles Wheatly, author of <i>A Rational Illustration of the Book of
  Common Prayer</i>, in a letter to Dr. Rawlinson, the nonjuring titular
  bishop of London, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I believe most of the books in Mr. Laurence's catalogue were really
  in his library. Most of his chapel furniture I had seen; but his pix, and
  his cruet, his box for unguent, and oil, I suppose you do not inquire
  after."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Roger Laurence was the learned author of <i>Lay Baptism Invalid</i>.
  Query, Where did he officiate?</p>

  <p>The Rev. John Lindsay, the translator of Mason's <i>Vindication of the
  Church of England</i>, for many years officiated as minister of a
  nonjuring congregation in Trinity Chapel, Aldersgate Street, and is said
  to have been their last minister.</p>

  <p>Thoresby, in his <i>Diary</i>, May 18, 1714, says, "I visited Mr.
  Nelson (author of the <i>Fasts and Festivals</i>), and the learned Dr.
  George Hickes, who not being at liberty for half an hour, I had the
  benefit of the prayers in the adjoining church, and when the Nonjuring
  <i>Conventicle</i> was over, I visited the said Dean Hickes, who is said
  to be bishop of &mdash;&mdash;" [Thetford]. Both Nelson and Hickes
  resided at this time in Ormond Street; probably the conventicle was at
  one of their houses. It should be noted that Thoresby, having quitted the
  Conventicles of the Dissenters, had only recently joined what he calls
  the Church <i>established by law</i>. He appears to have known as much
  about the principles of the Nonjurors as he did of Chinese music.</p>

  <p>Dr. Welton's chapel in Goodman's Fields being visited (1717) by
  Colonel Ellis and other justices of the peace, with proper assistants,
  about two hundred and fifty persons were found there assembled, of whom
  but forty would take the oaths. The doctor refusing them also, was
  ordered to be proceeded against according to law.</p>

  <p>This reminds me of another Query. What has become of Dr. Welton's
  famous Whitechapel altar-piece, which Bishop Compton drove out of his
  church. Some doubts have been expressed whether that is the identical one
  in the Saint's Chapel of St. Alban's Abbey. A friend has assured the
  writer that he had seen it about twenty years ago, at a Roman Catholic
  meeting-house in an obscure court at Greenwich. It is not there now. The
  print of it in the library of the Society of Antiquaries is accompanied
  with these MS. lines by Mr. Mattaire:&mdash;</p>

      <p>False is the image, the resemblance faint,</p>
      <p>Judas, compared to Kennett, was a saint."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>One word more. The episcopal seal of the nonjuring bishops was a
  shepherd with a sheep upon his shoulders. The crozier which had been used
  by them, was, in 1839, in the possession of John Crossley Esq., of
  Scaitcliffe, near Todmorden.</p>

<h3>HOGARTH'S ILLUSTRATIONS OF HUDIBRAS.</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Butler's <i>Hudibras</i>, by Zach. Grey, LL.D. 2 vols. 8vo.
  Cambridge, 1744.</p>

  <p>"Best edition. Copies in fine condition are in considerable request.
  The cuts are beautifully engraved, and Hogarth is much indebted to the
  designer of them; but who he was does not appear."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The above remarks in Lowndes's <i>Bibliographical Manual</i> having
  caught my attention, they appeared to me somewhat obscure and
  contradictory; and as they seemed rather disparaging to the fame of
  Hogarth, of whose works and genius I am a warm admirer, I have taken some
  pains to ascertain what may have been Mr. Lowndes's meaning.</p>

  <p>On examining the plates in Dr. Grey's edition, they are all inscribed
  "<i>W. Hogarth inv<sup>t</sup>, J. Mynde sc<sup>t</sup></i>." <!-- Page
  356 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page356"></a>{356}</span>How, then,
  can Hogarth be said to be <i>much indebted to the designer of them</i>,
  if we are to believe the words on the plates themselves&mdash;"<i>W.
  Hogarth inv<sup>t</sup>"?</i></p>

  <p>It is clear that Mr. Lowndes supposes the designer of these plates to
  have been some person distinct from Hogarth; and he was right in his
  conjecture; but he was ignorant of the name of the artist alluded to.</p>

  <p>Whoever he was, he can have little claim to be regarded as the
  original designer; he was rather employed as an expurgator; for these
  plates are certainly copies of the two sets of plates invented and
  engraved by Hogarth himself in 1726.</p>

  <p>All that this second designer performed was, to revise the original
  designs of Hogarth's, in order to remove some <i>glaring indecencies</i>;
  and this, no doubt, is what Mr. Lowndes means, when he says that
  "<i>Hogarth is much indebted to the designer of them</i>."</p>

  <p>The following passage in a letter from Dr. Ducaral to Dr. Grey, dated
  Inner Temple, May 10th, 1743, printed In Nichols's <i>Illustrations</i>,
  will furnish us with <i>the name</i> of the artist in
  question:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I was at <i>Mr. Isaac Wood's the painter</i>, who showed me the
  twelve sketches of <i>Hudibras</i>, which he designs for you. I think
  they are extremely well adapted to the book, and that the designer shows
  how much he was master of the subject."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the preface to this edition, Dr. Grey expresses his obligations "to
  the ingenious <i>Mr. Wood, painter, of Bloomsbury-square</i>."</p>

  <p>In the fourth volume of Nichols's <i>Illustrations of Literature</i>
  are some interesting letters from Thos. Potter, Esq., to Dr. Grey, which
  throw much light on the subject of this edition of <i>Hudibras</i>.</p>

  <p>I cannot conclude these observations without expressing my dissent
  from the praise bestowed upon the engravings in this work. Mr. Lowndes
  says "<i>the cuts are beautifully engraved</i>." With the exception of
  the head of Butler by Vertue, the rest are very spiritless and
  indifferent productions.</p>

  <p><i>Death-bed Superstitions.</i>&mdash;When a child is dying, people,
  in some parts of Holland, are accustomed to shade it by the curtains from
  the parent's gaze; the soul being supposed to linger in the body as long
  as a compassionate eye is fixed upon it. Thus, in Germany, he who sheds
  tears when leaning over an expiring friend, or, bending over the
  patient's couch, does but wipe them off, enhances, they say, the
  difficulty of death's last struggle. I believe the same poetical
  superstition is recorded in <i>Mary Barton, a Tale of Manchester
  Life</i>.</p>

  London, 1648.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Seeing then that Man is so very earthly, therefore he hath none but
  earthly knowledge, except he be regenerated in the Gate of Deep. He

  regicide. They point to old halls formerly in possession of Bradshaws,
  now passed into other hands, and shake their heads and say, "It is a bad
  name,&mdash;no Bradshaw will come to good." I heard this speech only
  yesterday in connexion with Halton Hall (on the Lune); but the feeling is
  common, and not confined to the uneducated classes.</p>

  <p>Haigh Hall remains in the possession of the descendants of the family
  from which Judge Bradshaw was descended, because, so said my informant,
  the heiress married a "loyal Lindsay" (the Earl of Balcarras).</p>

<h2>MINOR NOTES.</h2>

  <p><i>Rollin's Ancient History and History of the Arts and
  Sciences.</i>&mdash;It may be useful to note, for the benefit of some of
  your student readers, that the most procurable editions of Rollin's
  <i>Ancient History</i> are deficient, inasmuch as they do not contain his
  History of the Arts and Sciences, which is an integral part of the work.
  After having possessed several editions of the work of Rollin, I now have
  got Blackie's edition of 1837, in 3 vols. 8vo., edited by Bell; and I
  learn from its preface that this is the only edition published since 1740
  containing the History of the Arts and Sciences.</p>

  <p>How comes it that the editions since 1740 have been so castrated ?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Iota.</span>

  <p>Liverpool, October 16. 1850.</p>

  <p><i>Jezebel.</i>&mdash;The name of this queen is, I think, incorrectly
  translated in all the <i>Bible Dictionaries</i> and <i>Cyclopædias</i>
  that have come under my notice. It was common amongst all ancient nations
  to give <i>compound</i> names to persons, partly formed from the names of
  their respective <i>divinities</i>. This observation applies particularly
  to the Assyrians, Babylonians, and their dependencies, together with the
  Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Egyptians, and Greeks. Hence we find, both in
  scripture and profane history, a number of names compounded of
  <i>Baal</i>, such as <i>Baal</i>-hanan, Gen. xxxvi. 38., the gift, grace,
  mercy, or favour of <i>Baal</i>; the name of the celebrated Carthaginian
  general, Hanni<i>bal</i>, is the same name transposed. The father of the
  Tyrian prince, Hiram, was called Abi<i>bal</i>, my father is <i>Baal</i>,
  or <i>Baal</i> is my father. Esh<i>baal</i>, the fire of <i>Baal</i>;
  Jerub<i>baal</i>, let <i>Baal</i> contend, or defend his cause;
  Meri<i>baal</i>, he that resists <i>Baal</i>, or strives against the
  <i>idol</i>, were Hebrew names, apparently imposed to ridicule those
  given in honor of <i>Baal</i>. The father of <i>Jezebel</i> was called
  Eth<i>baal</i>, Kings xvi. 31., (classically, Itho<i>balus</i>,) with
  <i>Baal</i>, towards <i>Baal</i>, or him <i>that rules</i>. Lastly,
  Hasdru<i>bal</i> signifies help or assistance of <i>Baal</i>. Will some
  of the talented contributors to "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>" inform me what is the <i>composition</i> and
  <i>meaning</i> of <i>Jezebel</i>, as it has hitherto baffled my own
  individual researches? Is it the contracted <i>feminine form</i> of
  Hasdru<i>bal</i>?</p>

  <p><i>Clarendon, Oxford Edition of 1815.</i>&mdash;The following curious
  fact, relating to the Oxford edition of Lord Clarendon's History in 1815,
  was communicated to me by a gentleman who was then officially interested
  in the publication, and personally cognisant of the circumstances.</p>

  <p>In the year 1815, the University of Oxford determined to reprint
  Clarendon's <i>History of the Rebellion</i>, and to add to it that of the
  Irish rebellion; but as it was suspected by one of the delegates of the
  press, that the edition from which they were printing the "Irish
  Rebellion" was spurious, as it attributed the origin of the rebellion
  <i>to the Protestants instead of the Catholics</i>; a much earlier copy
  was procured from Dublin, through the chaplain of the then Lord
  Lieutenant, which <i>reversed the accusation</i> which was contained in
  the copy from which the University had been about to print.</p>

  <p><i>Macaulay's Country Squire.</i>&mdash;I suppose I may take it for
  granted that all the world has long since been made merry by Mr.
  Macaulay's description of "the country squire on a visit to London in
  1685." (<i>History of England</i>, vol. i. p. 369.)</p>

  <p>I am not aware that Steele's description of a country gentleman under
  similar circumstances has ever been referred to; it is certainly far from
  being as graphic as Mr. Macaulay's; but the one may at all events serve
  to illustrate the other, and to prove that Urbs had not made any very
  great progress in <i>urbanity</i> between 1685 and 1712.</p>

  imagined how the polite rabble of this town, who are acquainted with
  these objects, ridicule his rusticity. I have known a fellow with a
  burden on his head steal a hand down from his load, and slily twirl the
  cock of a squire's hat behind him; and while the offended person is
  swearing or out of countenance, all the wag-wits in the highway are
  grinning in applause of the ingenious rogue that gave him the tip, and
  the folly of him who had not eyes all round his head to prevent receiving
  it."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>, No. 354.</p>

  misprint for the Spanish words <i>Mucho Malhecho</i>, <i>much
  mischief</i>: <i>Hamlet</i>, iii. 2. Imagining that I had seen this
  ingenious conjecture somewhere in print before, I referred to, and was
  disappointed when I found it not in Knight's <i>Shakspeare</i> (library
  ed.). Recently, in looking over Dr. Maginn's admirable dissections of
  <i>Dr. Farmer's Essay on the Learning of Shakspeare</i>, I discovered
  what I was in search of, and beg to present it to the notice of your

  particular passages, as they are sufficiently familiar to readers of
  voyages and travels in the South Sea hemisphere; and although they
  exhibit some diversity in the <i>modus operandi</i>, the principle
  involved is essentially the same in each mode. I need scarcely add, that
  I am of course well aware of the means by which, whether by accident or
  design, heat is ordinarily generated by friction in this country.</p>

  <p><i>Captain John Stevens.</i>&mdash;I should be glad to learn some
  account of <i>Capt. John Stevens</i>, the continuator of Dugdale's
  <i>Monasticon</i> in 1722. He is generally considered to have edited the
  English abridgment of the <i>Monasticon</i>, in one vol. 1718, though a
  passage in Thoresby's <i>Diary</i> mentions that it contained "some
  reflections upon the Reformation, which the <i>Spanish Priest</i>, who is
  said to be translator and abridger of the three Latin volumes, would not
  omit."</p>

  <p><i>Le Bon Gendarme.</i>&mdash;Close to the boundary stone which

  public-house, known as "The Black Bull." So late as three months ago, in
  addition to the sign of the Black Bull, there was painted over the door,
  but somewhat high up, a worn-out inscription, "Le Bon Gendarme," as if
  that had originally been the name of the inn. These words have been
  lately effaced altogether: but as they no doubt relate to some
  circumstance or adventure which had happened in or near to the place,
  perhaps some reader of the "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>"

  the inn in vain for a solution.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>

<h3>TASSO TRANSLATED BY FAIRFAX.</h3>

  <p>The variation in the first stanza of Fairfax's <i>Godfrey of
  Bulloigne</i> has been long known to bibliographers, and was pointed out
  in <i>The Critical Review</i> more than thirty years ago. I cannot fix on
  the particular number, but it contained a long notice of the version of
  Tasso by Fairfax, and the very stanzas extracted by T.&nbsp;N. The translator
  could not please himself with the outset of his undertaking, and hence
  the recorded substitution; but it is not known that he carried his
  fastidiousness so far as to furnish a <i>third</i> version of the first
  stanza, as well as of the "Argument" of the introductory canto, differing
  from both the others. In the instance pointed out by T.&nbsp;N. the
  substitution was effected by pasting the <i>approved</i> stanza over the
  <i>disapproved</i> stanza; but the <i>third</i> version was given by
  reprinting the whole leaf, which contains other variations of typography,
  besides such as it was thought necessary to make in the first stanza.</p>

  <p>I formerly had copies of the book, dated 1600, including all three
  variations; but the late Mr. Wordsworth having one day looked
  particularly at that with the reprinted leaf, and expressing a <!-- Page
  360 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page360"></a>{360}</span>strong
  wish to possess it, I gave it to him, and I presume that it remained in
  his library at his death. What I speak of happened full twenty years
  ago.</p>

  <p><i>The Critical Review</i> of the date I refer to (I am pretty
  confident that it was of the early part of 1817) contained a good deal of
  information regarding Fairfax and his productions; but it did not mention
  one fact of importance to show the early estimation and popularity of his
  translation of the <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i>, viz., that although it
  was published in 1600, it is repeatedly quoted in <i>England's
  Parnassus</i>, printed in the same year, and containing extracts, as most
  people are aware, from all the distinguished poets of that day, and
  somewhat earlier. This circumstance ascertains also that Fairfax's Tasso
  came out before <i>England's Parnassus</i>, although both bear the date
  of 1600 on the title-pages.</p>

  <p><i>Fairfax's Tasso.</i>&mdash;In my copy of the second edition, 1624,
  the first stanza of the first book is given precisely as in Mr. Knight's
  reprint. But in the very beautiful edition published by Bensley, 1817,
  and edited by Mr. Singer, that stanza which T.&nbsp;N. terms an "elegant
  variation," introduces the canto. The editor's preface states that the
  <i>first</i> edition, 1600, had been followed in that re-impression,
  "admitting some few corrections of errors, and emendations of
  orthography, from the <i>second</i>, I printed in 1624." Of this second
  edition it is remarked that "it appears to have been revised by some
  careful corrector of the press; yet nothing material is changed but the
  orthography of particular words." No notice is taken of the difference
  between the first stanza of the second edition, and that of the first
  edition, identical with the cancel in T.&nbsp;N.'s copy. Possibly, <i>both</i>
  the copies of these two editions, which happened to come under the
  editor's notice, had this cancel, and so presented no variation from each
  other. If, however, <i>all</i> the copies of the second edition contained
  the stanza as given by Mr. Knight, and Mr. Singer's opinion (drawn from
  the dedicatory verses to Prince Charles, prefixed to <i>some</i> copies
  of the second edition) that this edition <i>was</i> seen, and probably
  corrected, by the author, be well-founded, it would seem to follow that
  Fairfax finally preferred the stanza in this its first and later state,
  and as it appears in Mr. Knight's edition. If the "cancel-slip" be an
  "elegant" variation, may not the original stanza be regarded as more
  vigorous?</p>

  <p><i>Fairfax's Tasso.</i>&mdash;In the elegant edition published by Mr.
  Singer in 1817, the first stanza is printed according to the variation
  noticed by your correspondent T.&nbsp;N. (Vol. ii., p. 325.), "I sing the
  warre," &amp;c., and the original stanza is printed at the end of the
  first book, with a note stating that the pasted slip is found "in most
  copies" of the first edition. My copy contains no such peculiarity, but
  it is of course possible that the pasted slip may have been removed. The
  second edition (folio, London, 1624) has the stanza in the form in which
  it originally stood in the first, beginning "The sacred armies,"
  &amp;c.</p>

<h3>ALE-DRAPER.&mdash;EUGENE ARAM.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 310.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent D. asks whether the word <i>ale-draper</i> was ever
  in "good use." The only place in which I can find it is Bailey's
  <i>Dictionary</i>, where it occurs thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ale-draper (a humorous name), a seller of malt liquors; an
  alehouse-keeper or victualler."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The humour, I suppose, consists in applying to one kind of occupation
  that which was commonly given to another; in taking <i>draper</i> from
  the service of cloth, and pressing it by force into that of <i>ale</i>.
  That it was ever considered as a word of respectable standing, can hardly
  be imagined. In such writers as Tom Brown it is most likely to occur.</p>

  <p>1. With reference to Eugene Aram, D.'s remark about the
  <i>over-ingeniousness</i> of his defence has been anticipated by Paley,
  who was present at the trial, and said that Aram would not have been
  hanged had he less studiously defended himself. That laboured address to
  the jury must have employed his thoughts for years. I should like very
  much to know whether anyone has ever attempted to verify the references
  which he gives to the cases in which he says that bones have been found.
  The style of the speech has been much praised, but is surely not very
  surprising when it is considered that Johnson had previously written the
  <i>Rambler</i>. The composition wants ease.</p>

  <p>2. Ever since I began to read about Eugene Aram, and that is some
  years ago, I have had a settled opinion that his attainments, and perhaps
  his abilities, had been greatly overrated. He was doubtless a man of
  considerable mental powers; but we cannot but suspect that had he
  acquired all the learning which is attributed to him, he would have
  attracted more notice than it was his fortune to obtain.</p>

  <p>3. Mr. Scatchard's attempts, and all other attempts, to clear him from
  "blood-guilty stain," must be equally futile, for he himself confessed
  his guilt while he was in prison.</p>

  <p>Some time ago, a dozen years or more, there appeared in the
  <i>Literary Gazette</i>, as a communication from a correspondent, an
  anecdote concerning Aram, which well deserves to be repeated. During the
  time that he was in the school of Lynn, it was the custom for the
  head-master, at the termination of every half-year, to invite the parents
  of the boys to an entertainment, and all <!-- Page 361 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page361"></a>{361}</span>who accepted the
  invitation were expected to bring with them the money due on account of
  their sons, which, <i>postquam exempta fames epulis</i>, they paid into
  the head-master's hands. The master would thus retire to rest with a
  considerable sum in his possession. On one of these occasions, after he
  had gone to his chamber and supposed that all the family were in bed, he
  heard a noise in a passage not far distant, and, going out to see what
  was the cause of it, found Aram groping about in the dark, who, on being
  asked what he wanted, said that he had been obliged to leave his room on
  a necessary occasion, and had missed his way to the place which he
  sought. The passage was not one into which he was likely to wander by
  mistake, but the master accepted his excuse, and thought no more of the
  matter till Aram was arrested for the robbery and murder of Clarke, when
  he immediately recollected the circumstance, and suspected that he had
  intended on that night to commit another robbery or murder. I have not
  the number of the <i>Literary Gazette</i> in which this statement was
  given to refer to, but I am sure that I have repeated the substance of it
  correctly, and remember that it was inserted as being worthy of credit.
  It is another illustration of the fact that the nature of a man is
  unchangeable.</p>

  <p>Bulwer's novel, which elevates Aram from a school-assistant into a
  private gentleman, may have pleased those, if there were such, who knew
  nothing of Arum's acts before they began to read it. But all who knew
  what Aram was, must be disgusted at the threshold. I regarded the book,
  at the time of its appearance, as one of the most presumptuous
  falsifications of biography that had ever been attempted. It is not easy
  to see why Bulwer might not have made an equally interesting story, if he
  had kept Aram in his proper station.</p>

<h3>ON THE WORD "GRADELY."</h3>

  <p>Permit me to make a few remarks on the word <i>gradely</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. It seems to have no connexion with the Latin noun <i>gradus</i>,
  Angl. <i>grade</i>, step.</p>

  <p>2. Its first syllable, <i>grade</i>, is both a substantive and an
  adjective; and <i>gradely</i> itself both adjective and adverb, as
  <i>weakly</i>, <i>sickly</i>, <i>godly</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>3. It is not confined to Lancashire or to England, but appears in
  Scotland as <i>graith</i> (ready), <i>graith</i> (furniture); whence
  <i>graithly</i> (readily), to <i>graith</i>, <i>grathe</i>, or
  <i>graid</i> (prepare), &amp;c. See Jamieson's <i>Sc. Dict.</i> and
  <i>Supplement</i>.</p>

  <p>4. It is in fact the Anglo-Saxon <i>gerad</i>, which is both
  substantive and adjective. As a substantive it means condition,
  arrangement, plan, reason, &amp;c. As an adjective, it means prudent,
  well-prepared, expert, exact, &amp;c. The <i>ge</i> (Gothic <i>ga</i>) is
  merely the intensive prefix; the root being <i>rad</i> or <i>rath</i>.
  The form in <i>ly</i> (adjective or adverb), without the prefix <i>g</i>,
  appears in the Anglo-Saxon <i>raedlic</i>, prudent, expert;
  <i>raedlice</i>, expertly. This interesting root, which appears as
  <i>re</i>, <i>ra</i>, <i>red</i>, <i>rad</i>, <i>rath</i>, &amp;c.;
  sometimes by transposition, as <i>er</i>, <i>ar</i>, <i>erd</i>, &amp;c.
  (perhaps also as <i>reg</i>, <i>rag</i>, <i>erg</i>, <i>arc</i>,
  &amp;c.), seems to represent the nobler qualities of man: thought,
  reason, counsel, speech, deliberate action; and perhaps, also,
  government.</p>

  <p>Thus in the Semitic family of languages we have the radicals
  <i>rââ</i> (saw, foresaw, counselled); <i>râdhâ</i> (helped, ruled);
  <i>râthâd</i> (arranged); <i>râto</i> (directed, instructed); and others,
  with their numerous derivatives.</p>

  <p>The Indo-European family gives us, in Sanscrit, <i>râ</i> or
  <i>râe</i> (ponder, experience); <i>rât</i> (speak); <i>râdh</i>
  (accomplish); <i>râj</i> (excel); <i>râgh</i> (attain, reach); and
  others, with derivatives. In Greek, <i>rheô</i> (speak), transp.
  <i>erô</i> or <i>werô</i> (whence <i>verbum</i>, <i>wort</i>,
  <i>word</i>); <i>rherô</i> or <i>rhedô</i> (do), transp. <i>erdô</i>,
  also <i>ergô</i> (whence <i>werke</i>, <i>work</i>); <i>archô</i> (rule),
  and others, with derivatives. In Latin, <i>reor</i> (think), whence
  <i>ratus</i> and <i>ratio</i> (reason); <i>res</i> (thing, action);
  <i>rego</i> (rule), with derivatives (<i>rex</i>, <i>regula</i>,
  <i>rectus</i>, &amp;c.). In Celtic (Welsh), <i>rhe</i> (active);
  <i>rheswm</i> (reason); <i>rhaith</i> (judgment, right); <i>rhi</i>
  (prince); <i>rhag</i> (van, before). In Sclavonic, <i>rada</i>,
  <i>rade</i> (counsel); <i>redian</i> (to direct), &amp;c.</p>

  <p>In the Teutonic dialects (Gothic, Anglo-Saxon, German, Dutch, Swedish,
  Danish, Icelandic, Scotch, and English) the forms of this root are very
  numerous. Thus we have, in Anglo-Saxon, <i>rad</i>, <i>raed</i>
  (counsel); <i>raedlich</i>, <i>grad</i>, as above, whence <i>geradien</i>
  (to prepare), and other words. In German, <i>rede</i> (discourse);
  <i>rath</i> (counsel); <i>reden</i> (to speak); <i>regel</i> (a rule);
  <i>recht</i> (right); <i>gerecht</i> (just); <i>gerade</i> (exactly),
  &amp;c.; <i>bereiten</i> (prepare), &amp;c. In English, <i>ready</i>,
  <i>read</i>, <i>rule</i>, <i>right</i>, <i>riddle</i>, <i>reason</i>,
  <i>rather</i>, to which we must add <i>gradely</i>. In Scotch,
  <i>red</i>, <i>rede</i>, <i>rade</i>, <i>rath</i>, &amp;c., with the
  words mentioned above; of which <i>graith</i> (furniture) is the German
  <i>geräth</i>. Your readers will derive much information on this class of
  words by reference to Jamieson, under <i>red</i>, <i>rede</i>,
  <i>rath</i>, <i>graith</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Shrewsbury, Oct. 19.</p>

  <p><i>Gradely</i>.&mdash;It seems rather a rash step to differ from the
  mass of critical authority with which your last number has brought this
  shy, old-fashioned provincial word into a blaze of literary notoriety.
  Yet I cannot help conceiving the original form of this adverb to be
  <i>grathedly</i> (<a href="images/009a.png"><img src="images/009a.png"
  class="middle" style="height:1.8ex" alt="Old English: geraðlic" /></a>,
  root <a href="images/009b.png"><img src="images/009b.png" class="middle"
  style="height:1.8ex" alt="Old English: rað" /></a>, with the preteritive
  prefix <a href="images/009c.png"><img src="images/009c.png"
  class="middle" style="height:1.8ex" alt="Old English: ge" /></a>) or
  <i>gerathely</i>. In our Yorkshire dialect, to <i>grathe</i> (pronounced
  <i>gradhe</i>) means, to make ready, to put in a state of <i>order</i> or
  <i>fitness</i>. A man inconveniently accoutred or furnished with
  implements for the performance of some operation on which he was
  employed, <!-- Page 362 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page362"></a>{362}</span>observed to me the other day, "I's ill
  grathed for't job"&mdash;rather a terse Saxon contrast to my latinized
  paraphrase.</p>

  <p><i>Grathedly</i> would then mean, "In a state of good order, fitness,
  readiness, or perfection."</p>

  <p>To the cognate German <i>gerade</i> adv., I find the senses,
  "directly, just, exactly, <i>perfectly</i>, rightly."</p>

  <p>The prevailing impression given by your numerous testimonials as to
  the character of the word <i>gradely</i>, is one of decency, order,
  rightness, perfectness.</p>

  <p>I fancy the whole family (who might be called the children of
  <i>rath</i>), viz. <a href="images/009b.png"><img src="images/009b.png"
  class="middle" style="height:1.8ex" alt="Old English: rað" /></a>,
  <i>rathe</i> (<i>gerathe, grathedly, gradely</i>), <i>rather</i> (only a
  Saxon form of <i>readier</i>), have as a common primeval progenitor the
  Sanscrit <a href="images/010a.png"><img src="images/010a.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2.2ex" alt="Sanskrit: radh" /></a>
  (<i>radh</i>), which is interpreted "a process towards perfection;" in
  other words, "a becoming ready."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">G. J. Cayley.</span>

  <p>Wydale, Oct. 21.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;<i>Greadly</i> is probably a transposition for
  <i>geradly</i>. The Yorkshire pronunciation of <i>gradely</i> is almost
  as if written <i>grared-ly</i>.</p>

  <p>I think it probable that the words <i>greed, greedily</i>, are from
  the same radicle. By the way, is <i>radix</i> perhaps derived from <a
  href="images/010b.png"><img src="images/010b.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2.2ex" alt="Sanskrit: rad" /></a> (<i>rad</i>), a tooth
  (from the fang-like form of roots), whence <i>rodere</i> and possibly
  <i>radius</i>?</p>

<h3>COLLAR OF ESSES.</h3>

  <p>Although the suggestion made by C. (Vol. ii., p. 330.), <i>viz.</i>
  that the Collar of Esses had a "mechanical" origin, resulting from the
  mode of forming "the chain," and that "the <i>name</i> means no more than
  that the links were in the shape of the letter S.," could only be
  advocated by one unacquainted with the real formation of the collar, yet,
  as I am now pledged before the readers of "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>" as the historiographer of livery collars, it may be
  expected that I should make some reply. This may be accompanied with the
  remark, that, about the reign of Henry VIII., a collar occurs, which
  might be adduced in support of the theory suggested by the <span
  class="sc">Rev. Mr. Ellacombe</span>, and adopted by C. It looks like a
  collar formed of esses; but it is not clear whether it was meant to do
  so, or was merely a rich collar of twisted gold links. That was the age
  of ponderous gold collars, but which were arbitrary features of
  ornamental costume, not collars of livery. Such a collar, however,
  resembles a series of esses placed obliquely and interlaced, as thus:
  <i>SSSS</i>; not laid flat on their sides, as figured by C. Again, it is
  true an (endless) <i>chain</i> of linked esses was formed merely by
  attaching the letters <a href="images/010c.png"><img
  src="images/010c.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="three
  letter Ss horizontally" /></a> like hooks together. This occurs on the
  cup at Oriel College, Oxford, engraved in Shaw's <i>Ancient Furniture</i>
  in Shelton's <i>Oxonia Illustrata</i>, and in the <i>Gentleman's
  Magazine</i> for August last; but the connexion of this with the English
  device is at least very doubtful. The cup is not improbably of foreign
  workmanship, and Menneus assigns such a collar to the knights of Cyprus;
  even there the S was not without its attributed import:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Per literam autem S. quæ <i>Silentii</i> apud Romanos nota fuit,
  secretum societatis et amicitiæ simulachrum, individuamque pro patriæ
  defensione <i>Societatem</i> denotari."&mdash;<i>Fr. Mennenii Deliciæ
  Equest. Ordinum</i>, 1613. 12mo. p. 153.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>However, the answer to the suggestion of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Ellacombe</span> and C. consists in this important distinction, that the
  Lancastrian livery collar was <i>not a chain</i> of linked esses, but a
  collar of leather or other stiff material, upon which the letters were
  <i>distinctly</i> figured at certain intervals; and when it came to be
  made of metal only, the letters were still kept distinct and upright. On
  John of Ghent's collar, in the window of old St. Paul's (which I have
  already mentioned in p. 330.), there are only five,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>S &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; S &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; S &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; S &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; S,</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>at considerable intervals. On the collar of the poet Gower the letters
  occur thus,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>SSSSS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SSSSS.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>S | S | S | S | S | S |</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There is then, I think, little doubt that this device was the
  <i>symbolum</i> or <i>nota</i> of some word of which S was the initial
  letter; whether <i>Societas</i>, or <i>Silentium</i>, or
  <i>Souvenance</i>, or <i>Soveraigne</i>, or <i>Seneschallus</i>, or
  whatever else ingenuity or fancy may suggest, this is the
  question,&mdash;a question which it is scarcely possible to settle
  authoritatively without the testimony of some unequivocal contemporary
  statement. But I flatter myself that I have now clearly shown that the
  esses were neither the <i>links of a chain</i> nor yet (as suggested in a
  former paper) identical with the <i>gormetti fremales</i>, or
  horse-bridles, which are said to have formed the livery collar of the
  King of Scots.</p>

  <p>By the same sort of reasoning&mdash;viz. conjecture&mdash;that <span

  <span class="sc">Mr. Nichols</span>, and those who pin faith upon his

  our kings upon certain of their retainers, in much the same sense and
  fashion as Cedric the Saxon is said to have given a collar to Wamba, the
  son of Witless. For myself, and all those entitled to carry armorial
  bearings in the kingdom, I repudiate the notion that the knightly golden
  Collar of SS. was ever so conferred or received. Further, I maintain that
  there was a distinction between what <span class="sc">Mr. Nichols</span>
  calls "the Livery Collar of SS.," and the said knightly golden Collar of
  SS., as marked and broad as is the difference between the Collar of the

  <p>In his last communication <span class="sc">Mr. Nichols</span> lays it
  down that "livery collars were perfectly distinct from collars of
  knighthood;" adding, they did not exist until a subsequent age. Of course
  the collars of such royal orders of knighthood as have been established
  since the days of our Lancastrian kings had necessarily no existence at
  the period to which he refers. But Gough (not <span class="sc">Mr. Gough
  Nichols</span>) mentions that the Collar of SS. was upon the monument of
  Matilda Fitzwalter, of Dunmow, who lived in the reign of King John; and
  Ashmole instances a monument in the collegiate church at Warwick, with
  the portraiture of Margaret, wife of Sir William Peito, said to have been
  sculptured there in the reign of Edward III. What credit then are we to
  attach to <span class="sc">Mr. N.</span>'s averment, that the "Collar of
  Esses was not a badge of knighthood, nor a badge of personal merit, but
  was a collar of livery, and the idea typified by livery was feudal
  dependence, or what we now call party?" What sort of feudal dependence
  was typified by the ensign of equestrian nobility upon the necks of the
  two ladies named, or upon the neck of Queen Joan of Navarre? <span
  class="sc">Mr. Nichols</span> states that in the first Lancastrian reigns
  the Collar of SS. had no pendant, though, afterwards, it had a pendant
  called "the king's beast." On the effigy of Queen Joan the collar
  certainly has no pendant, except the jewelled ring of a trefoil form. But
  on the ceiling and canopy of the tomb of Henry IV., his arms, and those
  of his queen (Joan of Navarre), are surrounded with Collars of SS., the
  king's terminating in an eagle volant (rather an odd sort of a beast),
  whilst the pendant of the queen's has been defaced.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Nichols</span>, in a postscript, puts this query
  to the antiquaries of Scotland: "Can any of them help me to the authority
  from which Nich. Upton derived his livery collar of the King of Scotland
  de gormettis fremalibus equorum?" If Mr. N. puts this query from no other
  data than the citation given in my former paper upon this subject (vide
  Vol. ii., p. 194.), he need not limit it to the antiquaries of Scotland.
  Upton's words are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Rex etiam scocie dare solebat pro signo vel titulo suo, unum
  collarium de gormettis fremalibus equorum de auro vel argento."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This passage neither indicates that a King of Scotland is referred to,
  nor does it establish that the collar was given as a livery sign or
  title. It merely conveys something to this purport, that the king was
  accustomed to give to his companions, as a sign or title, a collar of
  gold or silver shaped like the bit of a horse's bridle.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Nichols</span> takes exception to Favine as an
  heraldic authority. Could that erudite author arise from his grave, I
  wonder how he would designate <span class="sc">Mr. Nichols's</span>
  lucubrations on livery collars, &amp;c. But hear Matthew Paris: that
  learned writer says Equites Aurati were known in his day "by a gold ring
  on their thumbs, by a chain of gold about their necks, and gilt spurs."
  Let us look to Scotland: Nesbit says, vol. ii. p. 87.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Our knights were no less anciently known by belts than by their gilt
  spurs, swords, &amp;c. In the last place is the collar, an ensign of
  knightly dignity among the Germans, Gauls, Britains, Danes, Goths,
  &amp;c. In latter times it was the peculiar fashion of knights amongst us
  to wear golden collars composed of SS."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Brydson, too, in his <i>Summary View of Heraldry in reference to the
  Usages of Chivalry, and the General Economy of the Feudal System</i>, (a
  work of uncommon ingenuity, deserving to be called the Philosophy of
  Heraldry), observes, p. 186, ch. v., that knights were distinguished by
  an investiture which implied superior merit and address in arms&mdash;by
  the attendance of one or more esquires&mdash;by the title <span
  class="sc">Sir</span>&mdash;by wearing a crest&mdash;a helmet of peculiar
  form&mdash;apparel peculiarly splendid&mdash;polished armour of a
  particular construction&mdash;gilded spurs&mdash;and a <span
  class="sc">Golden Collar</span>.</p>

  <p>He states, ch. iv., p. 132.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the fifth dissertation of Du Cange it is shown that the splendid
  habits which the royal household anciently received at the great

  <p><i>Symbols of the Evangelists</i> (Vol. i., pp. 375. 471.; vol. ii.,
  pp. 13. 45. 205.).&mdash;Should the inquirer not have access to the
  authorities which, as is stated in p. 471., are referred to by <span
  class="sc">Dr. Wordsworth</span>, or not have leisure to avail himself of
  his copious references, he may be glad to find that in the <i>Thesaurus
  Theologico Philologicus</i> (vol. ii. pp. 57.-62.), there is a
  dissertation containing an analysis of more than fifty authors, who have
  illustrated the visions of Ezekiel and St. John, and an explanation of
  the Sententiarum Divortia of Irenæus, Jerome, and Augustine, respecting
  the application of the symbols, or of the quæstio vexata&mdash;quodnam
  animal cui Evangelistæ comparandum sit. Thomasius, the author of this
  dissertation, suggests that to recall to mind the symbol applied to Luke,
  we should remember the expression denoting elephantes, <i>boves
  lucas</i>. Abundant information is also supplied on this subject by that
  hierophantic naturalist, Aldrovandus, <i>de Quadrup. Bisulcis</i>, p.

  <p><i>Becket's Mother</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 106. 270.).&mdash;In support of
  the view of <span class="sc">Mr. Foss</span> with regard to Becket's
  mother, against that propounded by J.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;R. (Vol. ii., p. 270.), I would
  mention that <i>Acon</i> is the ordinary mediæval name for the city of
  <i>Acre</i>, and appears in the earlier deeds relating to the hospital in
  Cheapside, while the modern form occurs in those of later date;
  <i>e.g.</i> Pat. 18 Edw. II., "S. Thomæ Martyris <i>de Aconia</i>;" Pat.
  14 Edw. III., "S. Thomæ Martyris Cantuarensis de <i>Acon</i>;" but Rot.
  Parl. 23 Hen. VI., "Saint Thomas the Martir of <i>Acres</i>," "the Martyr
  of Canterbury of <i>Acres</i>." (Deeds in Dugdale, <i>Monast.</i> vi.
  646, 647.)</p>

  <p>This would seem to identify the distinctive name of the hospital with
  the city in the Holy Land but the following passage from the
  <i>Chronicle</i> of Matthew of Westminster (p. 257.) seems quite
  conclusive on this point, as it connects that city with Becket in a
  manner beyond all dispute:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Anno gratiæ 1190. Obsessa est <i>Acon</i> circumquaque Christianorum
  legionibus, et arctatur nimis. <i>Capella Sancti Thomæ martyris ibidem
  ædificatur</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If, as J. C. R. supposes, there was no connexion between the saint and
  Acre in Syria, the foundation of a chapel to his honour in or near that
  city would seem quite unaccountable. However this may be, the truth of
  the beautiful legend of his mother can, I fear, be never proved or
  disproved.</p>

  <p>While on this subject, let me, at the risk of being tedious to your
  readers, quote the amusing tale told by Latimer, with regard to this
  hospital, in his "Sixth Sermon preached before Edward VI." (Parker Soc
  ed., p. 201.):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I had rather that ye should come [to hear the Word of God] as the
  tale is by the gentlewoman of London: one of her neighbours met her in
  the street and said, 'Mistress, whither go ye?' 'Marry,' said she; 'I am
  going to St. Thomas of Acres, to the sermon; I could not sleep all this
  last night, and I am going now thither; I never failed of a good nap
  there.' And so I had rather ye should go a-napping to the sermons than
  not to go at all."</p>

  story that Becket's mother was a Saracen rests on the fact that no trace
  of it is found until a much later time, when the history of "St. Thomas
  of Canterbury" had been embellished with all manner of wonders. <span
  class="sc">Mr. Matthews</span> may find some information in the

  <p><i>Combs buried with the Dead</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 230. 269.).&mdash;On
  reference to Sir Thomas Browne's <i>Hydriotaphia</i>, I find two passages
  which may supply the information your correspondent seeks as to the
  reason for combs being buried with human remains. In section i., pp. 26,
  27. (I quote from the Edinburgh reprint of 1822, published by Blackwood)
  the author says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In a field of Old Walsingham, not many months past (1658), were
  digged up between forty and fifty urns, deposited in a dry and sandy
  soil, not a yard deep, not far from one another, not all strickly of one
  figure, but most answering these described; some containing two pounds of
  bones, distinguishable in skulls, ribs, jaws, thigh-bones, and teeth,
  with fresh impressions of their combustion, besides extraneous
  substances, like pieces of small boxes, or <i>combs</i>, handsomely
  wrought, handles of small brass instruments, brazen nippers, and in one
  some kind of opale."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And again he says (pp. 36, 37.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"From exility of bones, thinness of skulls, smallness of teeth, ribs,
  and thigh-bones, not improbable that many thereof were persons of minor
  age, or women. Confirmable also from things contained in them. In most
  were found substances resembling <i>combs</i>, plates like boxes,
  fastened with iron pins, and handsomely overwrought like the necks or
  bridges of musical instruments, long brass plates overwrought like the
  handles of neat implements, <i>brazen nippers to pull away hair</i>, and
  in one a kind of opale, yet maintaining a bluish colour.</p>

  <p>"Now that they accustomed to burn or bury with them things wherein
  they excelled, delighted, or which were dear unto them, either as
  farewells unto all pleasure, or vain apprehension that they might use
  them in the other world, is testified by all antiquity."</p>

  <p>Magius, "that prodigy of learning en pure perte" (Villebrune),
  concludes from the words of the text "the <i>heavens</i> shall pass
  away," that the <i>universe</i> will be dissolved; but that it will
  undergo mutation only, not annihilation.&mdash;Cf. Steuches <i>de Perenni
  Philosophia</i>, lib. x. </p>

  <p><i>Wraxen</i>, (Vol. ii., p. 207.).&mdash;<span class="sc">G. W.
  Skyring</span> will find the following explanation in Halliwell's
  <i>Dictionary of Provincial and Archaic Words</i>, "to grow out of
  bounds, spoken of weeds," c. Kent. Certainly an expressive term as used
  by the Kentish women.</p>

  <p class="author">J. D. A.

  <p><i>Wraxen.</i>&mdash;Probably analogous to the Northumbrian
  "<i>wrax</i>, wraxing, wraxed," signifying to stretch or (sometimes) to
  sprain.</p>

  <p>A peasant leaving overworked himself, would say he had <i>wraxed</i>
  himself; after sitting, would walk to <i>wrax</i> his legs. Falling on
  the ice would have <i>wraxed</i> his arm; and of a rope that has
  stretched considerably, he would say it had <i>wraxed a gay feck</i>.</p>

  <p>It may possibly have come, as a corruption, from the verb <i>wax</i>,
  to grow. It is a useful and very expressive word, although not recognised
  in polite language.</p>

  <p class="author">S. T. R.

  <p><i>Wraxen.</i>&mdash;Rax or Wrax is a very common word in the north of
  England, meaning to stretch, so that when the old Kentish woman told
  <span class="sc">Mr. Skyring's</span> friend her children were wraxen,
  she meant their minds were so overstretched during the week, that they
  required rest on Sunday.</p>

<h3>NOTES OF BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Of the various changes which have been made of late years in public
  education, there is not one so generally admitted to be an improvement as
  that which has made the study of</p>

  <p>an essential part of the system and probably no individual has so
  effectually contributed towards this important end as Dr. Latham, the
  third edition of whose masterly and philosophical volume, entitled <i>The
  English Language</i>, is mow before us. Dr. Latham has ever earnestly and
  successfully insisted on the <i>disciplinal</i> character of grammatical
  studies in general, combined with the fact, that the grammatical study of
  one's own language is exclusively so; and having established this theory,
  he has, by the production of various elementary works, exhibiting a happy
  combination of great philological acquirements with the ability to apply
  them in a logical and systematic manner, enabled those who shared his
  views to put that theory into practice. Hence the change in our
  educational system to which we have alluded. His volume entitled <i>The
  English Language</i> is, however, addressed to a higher class of <!--
  Page 367 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page367"></a>{367}</span>readers, and this third edition may justly
  be pronounced the most important contribution to the history of our
  native tongue which has yet been produced; and, as such every student of
  our early language and literature must, with us, bid it welcome.</p>
